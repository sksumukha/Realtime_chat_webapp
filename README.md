# Realtime_chat_webapp
Snappy - A Realtime Chat Web Application aims to conceive and execute Real-Time Chat processes, distinguished by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality. We have used MERN Stack to develop this project and socket.io is used to facilitate real-time chat communication. Open-source random avatar generator API is also used.
